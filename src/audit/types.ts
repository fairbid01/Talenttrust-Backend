/**
 * @module audit/types
 * @description Core type definitions for the TalentTrust immutable audit log system.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - AuditEntry is a sealed, readonly record — no field may be mutated after creation.
 * - Each entry carries a SHA-256 hash of its own content plus the previous entry's hash,
 *   forming a tamper-evident hash chain (similar to a blockchain ledger).
 * - Sensitive payloads are stored as opaque strings; callers must sanitise PII before logging.
